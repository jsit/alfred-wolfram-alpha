This workflow allows you to type get information from Wolfram|Alpha quickly.

Before this works, you'll need to get your own AppID. If you try to use the workflow before setting this up, you'll be politely directed to Wolfram|Alpha's AppID page.

It responds to two commands:

`w {your search here}`
`appid {your Wolfram|Alpha AppID}`

An example input would be:

`w diameter of the earth`

Note: due to slow responses from Wolfram|Alpha's servers, this workflow can take a long time to give you an answer. There's really nothing I can do about this. Sorry :disappointed:
